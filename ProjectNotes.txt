FIELDS THAT I ADDED TO MOVIE CLASS:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UserID - The id of the logged in user, type string.
isSharable - identifies if the movie is sharable or not, type boolean
Request - identifies the status of the borrow request, type string
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Workflow Explained:
1. Project's database has 2 tables: 1 table for the movies and another one for borrow requests.
2. The owner's and authenticated users' web menu both contain "home" and "movies" items, however,the owner has one extra "requests" item where borrowRequests pile up.
3. Once the user asks to borrow a movie, the "borrowRequest" object is created and put into database.
4. The owner views these requests in "requests" page where she/he can approve/reject them.
5. If the owner approves the request, the movie's sharedWith fields get filled and movie moves
to "My Movies" section of the user's page. 
5. If movie is rented, "return" button appears so that the owner can return it at any time.
6. Return button also appears in user's view, accross the movie under My Movies list.

Container Registry:
I implemented this project with Docker support, I created container registry too. However,
I was unable to deploy it because visual studio required Docker Desktop which itself
requirs Windows 10 Pro or higher operating system which I do not have.
